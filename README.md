I developed a dynamic traffic signal system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The signal transitions between red, yellow, and green lights, accurately mimicking real-world traffic control. 
CSS is used for styling and smooth animations, while JavaScript manages the timing and logic for seamless light changes.
